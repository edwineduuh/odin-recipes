    <h2>How to make cheese omlete</h2>
    <p>I love omelets! So easy and nutritious, with protein and a handful of veggies. This one keeps it simple but still tasty with hearty mushrooms and onions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coconut oil</li>
        <li>2 mushrooms, chopped</li>
        <li>1 green onions (green parts only), minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs together with milk, salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Mix in green onions; cook until slightly softened, about 1 minute. Pour in the beaten eggs. Cook and stir until the edges harden, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top. Cook until egg is set and cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Fold omelet in half; top with more Cheddar cheese.</li>
    </ol>
