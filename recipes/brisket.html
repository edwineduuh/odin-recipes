    <h2>How to make Beef Brisket</h2>
    <p>Making saucy, perfectly seasoned baked brisket is a breeze. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe:</p>
    <p>Start by generously seasoning both sides of the brisket, then refrigerate uncovered for 8-12 hours. Next, saute the onions over medium heat before adding the garlic, rosemary, and apple juice. Boil the mixture until the volume is reduced by half.</p>
    <p>Add the apple-onion mixture and brisket to a baking dish and cook at 325 degrees F for about 90 minutes. Reduce the heat, continue cooking for another 2 hours, and transfer the brisket to a foil-tented plate. Make a gravy with the braising liquid and serve with the sliced beef.</p>
